"""

You are tasked with developing a system to manage bank accounts.
The system should allow for the following operations:
  Deposit Money: Add a specified amount of money to a bank account.
  Withdraw Money: Subtract a specified amount of money from a bank account,
  but ensure that the account balance does not become negative.
  Check Balance: Retrieve the current balance of a bank account.
See example:

account = BankAccount(100)
account.deposit(50)
print(account.check_balance())  # Prints 150

account.withdraw(30)
print(account.check_balance())  # Prints 120

account.withdraw(100)
print(account.check_balance())  # Prints 20

account.withdraw(50)  # Prints "Insufficient funds"
print(account.check_balance())  # Prints 20


Once your classes are complete, copy and paste the above example below them in order to test their functionality
"""


"""
Write a class that meets these requirements.

Name:       BankAccount

Required state:
   * balance

Behavior:
   * check_balance()      # returns the current balance
   * deposit(amount)      # adds the new amount to the balance
   * withdraw(amount)     # removes the amount from the balance, but does not allow the balance to go negative
